Hi.

This is just a little script I made for my work. This is really bad python code for the software "RTS" you can find out what this is at 
http://wiki.readyticket.net/mw/index.php/Main_Page

I don't care what anyone else does with it, it is simply here to be accessible to my co-workers at Regency Theaters .Co

However, thank you for checking this out anyways, if have any suggestings for improving the code, make a pull request and I will check it out.

Thanks!
