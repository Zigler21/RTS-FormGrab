Hi.

This is just a little script I made for my work. This is just some python code for the software "RTS", you can find out what this is at 
http://wiki.readyticket.net/mw/index.php/Main_Page


This script does 3 things:

1. Prints and saves the deposit report document as a PDF
2. Prints and saves the Ticket Daily report document as a PDF
3. Saves the Inv vs Conc sales report as a PDF

Thank you for checking this out , if have any suggestings for improving the code, make a pull request and I will check it out.



### TODO
- Make the program not be dectected as a virus (virus total thinks its malicous since it takes control of the mouse to find the associated buttons on screen)
- Simplify code
